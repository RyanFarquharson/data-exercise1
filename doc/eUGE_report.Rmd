Being a closet greenie, and a scientist, I have been fascinated by energy and water use.  Many people seem to whinge about the cost of utilities with little to no understanding of how much they use, and how much they waste.  An almost daily ritual for me is to wander up to the water meter, then down to the rain gauge, and back up to the electricity meter and record all the numbers, by hand, into an exercise book.  Until now, I have done little with the data.  

This presented a great oportunity to hone some skills in data handling and visualisation, plus setting up file structures, version control etc.  What is described is not necessarily the best way to do things.  It has been a good learning experience!

## Methods

Meter readings were recorded by hand at the end of each day whenever possible from May 2009 to present

### Meter readings:
Date
Water (litres)
Peak 
Offpeak
PV feedin
PV generation
PV hours

Rainfall was also recorded, and climate data can be obtained from BOM, but we have left that out for now.

The raw meter readings were transcribed into a spreadsheet and saved as the meterreads.csv file.  FOr this exercise, instad of trying to transcribe all of the data (we're talking more than a thousand lines), I just took the full reads that were closest to the end of each month.

Some initial plots were done which revealed a number of typographical errors.  These were corrected by going back to the exercise book and checking the data.  Unfortunately I did not save or commit the incorrect file or the plots.  You'll just have to trust me on that!

### Directory structures
Being the first time I've worked like this, I manually set up a project folder and subfolders for doc, data, results.  I also set up a git repository and remote master.  I then opened up a new project in Rstudio.

### Data processing
First I loaded the tidyverse library and used read_csv to bring the meterreads.csv file in as a tibble.

```{r data processing, }
library(tidyverse)

meterreads <- read_csv("data/meterreads.csv")
meterreads
```

SOme exploratory data analysis was done using ggplot


```{r exploratory plots, }

#plot power reads i.e. peak, offpeak and PV

ggplot(meterreads, aes(x = date)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = peak_reading, colour = "peak")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = offpeak_reading, colour = "offpeak")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = PV_reading, colour = "PV")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = feedin_reading, colour = "PV feed-in")) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "kwh", title = "Power reads", colour = "Read type") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue","red","green","black"))

# plot PV hours in a seperate graph

ggplot(meterreads, aes(x = date, y = PVhours_reading)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "hours", title = "PVhours")

# plot water reading in a seperate graph

ggplot(meterreads, aes(x = date, y = water_reading)) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "litres", title = "Water")


```

So far so good.  You can see the meter reads going up over time with some bumps along the way.

But that hides most of the story.  What we actually need is usage.

THe first step to get usage is to get the diffence in each meter read from the previous reading.  To do this, I used mutate() and lag().

```{r getting usage from meter reads}
# make a new tibble called 'usage' from 'meterreads' and
# add a column called peak_usage by using mutate and lag
# mutate makes a new column called peak_usage by starting with peak_reading and subtracting a value
# this value is also from the peak_reading column, but by using lag it is from the previous row.

usage <- meterreads %>% 
  mutate(peak_usage = peak_reading - 
           lag(peak_reading, default = first(peak_reading)))

# now repeat the process for the other readings

usage <- usage %>% 
  mutate(offpeak_usage = offpeak_reading -
           lag(offpeak_reading, default = first(offpeak_reading)))

usage <- usage %>% 
  mutate(feedin_usage = feedin_reading -
           lag(feedin_reading, default = first(feedin_reading)))

usage <- usage %>% 
  mutate(PV_usage = PV_reading -
           lag(PV_reading, default = first(PV_reading)))

usage <- usage %>% 
  mutate(PVhours_usage = PVhours_reading -
           lag(PVhours_reading, default = first(PVhours_reading)))

usage <- usage %>% 
  mutate(water_usage = water_reading -
           lag(water_reading, default = first(water_reading)))

usage <- usage %>% 
  mutate(days = as.integer(date -
           lag(date, default = first(date))))

usage

```

There was probably a quicker way to do this, but for now, it did the trick.

So we now have the increment of power usage, generation and export between meter reads.  

But guess what.  Months have different numbers of days, and I couldn't always do a meter read at the end of the month.  So to compare between months, we need to get usage per day.

This was done by dividing each usage by the number of days in each increment.

```{per day}
# make a new table called perday.  divide usage by number of days to get usage per day.

perday <- usage %>% 
  mutate(peak_perday = peak_usage / days)

perday <- perday %>% 
  mutate(offpeak_perday = offpeak_usage / days)

perday <- perday %>% 
  mutate(totalusage_perday = peak_perday + offpeak_perday)

perday <- perday %>% 
  mutate(feedin_perday = feedin_usage / days)

perday <- perday %>% 
  mutate(PVgen_perday = PV_usage / days)

perday <- perday %>% 
  mutate(PVhours_perday = PVhours_usage / days)

perday <- perday %>% 
  mutate(water_perday = water_usage / days)

perday <- perday %>% 
  mutate(PVefficiency = PVgen_perday / PVhours_perday)

perday <- perday %>% 
  mutate(feedinefficiency = feedin_perday / PVhours_perday)

perday

```

Ok. Now we have something meaningful to work with.  

This is about to get exciting!  Having recored all of this data over 9 years, we're about to see what it looks like.

It took a few iterations and searching through help files ot get to this point, but here it is.

```{ggplot}
# Electricity overview in kwh per day

ggplot(perday, aes(x = date)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = peak_perday, colour = "peak")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = offpeak_perday, colour = "offpeak")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = PVgen_perday, colour = "PV generation")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = feedin_perday, colour = "PV feed-in")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = totalusage_perday, colour = "total usage")) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "kwh per day", title = "Electricity use, generation and export", colour = "Type") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue","red","green","black", "orange")) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 15.5, linetype = 2) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 19, linetype = 2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 13.09, linetype = 2, colour = "orange") 

# have put in some hlines to give seasonal averages for usage of 4 person households
# average household usage from energymadeeasy.gov.au.  
# 4 person household postcode 5051
# Summer 15.7; Autumn 15.5; WInter 19.0; Spring 16.1 kWh 

# calculate average total usage per day and add in an hline.

mean(perday$totalusage_perday, na.rm = TRUE)

# Here are some PV efficiency plots

ggplot(perday, aes(x = date, y = PVefficiency)) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "kwh per hour", title = "PV efficiency")

ggplot(perday, aes(x = date, y = feedinefficiency)) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "kwh per hour", title = "feedin efficiency")

# Combined

ggplot(perday, aes(x = date)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = PVefficiency, colour = "PV generation efficiency")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = feedinefficiency, colour = "feed-in efficiency")) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "kwh per hour", title = "PV efficiency") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("black","green"))


```

So many stories to tell!

## So what's going on?

Well, there's a bit of background to know.  

When this kicked off it was just the two of us in a small weatherboard cottage with a newish 1 kW PV system that we paid a lot of money for (could get one 5 times bigger for the same dosh today).

We run entirely on electricity.  We have a flat panel solar hot water system with offpeak electric resistance backup.  We also have a heat bank which again runs on offpeak electricity.  For a long time, this was our sole source of heating.

Then in July 2011 bubs 1 arrived, followed shortly by a heat pump. We've since been tweaking our mix of heat bank (offpeak) and heat pump (peak).

In January 2014 bubs 2 arrived.

We also have visitors and a supplementary hot water system kicks in, running on off peak.

So with that info, you can start to interpret the data.

One other hint. Our PV panels point north.  Around summer solstice, the sun rises and sets in the south east and south west, so there are many hours when the sun is up, the PVs are producing, but it's from diffuse light rather than direct light.  You can pick that up in the efficiency plots.

### Key findings

#### Seasonality

Both energy use and generation in our household are highly seasonal.

Use peaks in winter.

Generation peaks in summer.

#### 4 person households
Depsite living in a leaky 1949 weatherboard home run entirely on elctricity, our total usage is less than the average local 4 person household.


#### Take home messages

Unfortunately our electricity use and PV generation are completely at odds with each other.  For now, that's ok because we get a generous feed-in tarrif.  But that won't last long.  

It looks like taking the current hous off grid would be a challenge and counterproductive.  We would need a big system to meet heating demand in winter, and then will have a massive surplus in summer.  Given that the main electricity use is heating, alternate fuels could be considered.  Gas is avaiable but is a fossil fuel.  Wood could be used, but costs and requires work.



## Next steps
It would be interesting to get daily data, pull in some climate data from the BOM and see if we can model this.

We can do the same for water usage.
 
As we plan our new energy efficient house, we are considering heating options.  Do we need to fork out big $ for a very efficient and effective in-slab hydronic heating system?  Do we suffice with a wood oven?  Will our salvaged heat pump and heat bank be enough?

Whatever we end up with, rest assured that I will continue to record our meter readings and get back to you with some interesting data!
